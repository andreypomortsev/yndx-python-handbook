## [Excessive Automation](../../../solutions/2.1/21_c.py)

**"Repetition is the mother of learning!"** and **"If it can be automated — automate it!"**  
These principles are followed by many programmers. But what happens if we combine them?

### Input format:

One line — very useful information.

### Output format:

The very useful information repeated three times.

### Example 1

__Input__  
```plaintext
2 + 2 = 4
```

__Output__  
```plaintext
2 + 2 = 4
2 + 2 = 4
2 + 2 = 4
```

### Example 2

__Input__  
```plaintext
2 * 2 = 4
```

__Output__  
```plaintext
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 2 = 4
```
