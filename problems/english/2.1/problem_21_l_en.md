## [Interesting Addition](../../../solutions/2.1/21_l.py)

One little kid from kindergarten heard from his older sister about a certain operation with numbers — addition.  
And as it often happens, he didn't quite understand how addition works. For example, he didn't fully grasp how to carry over digits.  
Now, he wants to teach the other kids how to add, and asks to write a program that can help him as visual material.

### Input Format:

The first and second lines contain natural numbers less than 1000.
