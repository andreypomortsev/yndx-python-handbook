## [Balls and Pens](../../../solutions/2.1/21_n.py)

Sometimes the kids in the kindergarten get bored, so they constantly come up with simple but fun games.  
In the group, there is a box with an unknown number of balls of the following colors:

- red;
- green;
- blue.

The game is that each child approaches the box and, without looking, pulls out one ball. The winner is the one who draws the green ball first.  
How many moves will it take at most for the children to find the winner of the game?

### Input Format
