## [Cash Register Error](../../../solutions/2.1/21_q.py)

We have already helped the store with calculations and receipt generation, but today the cash register started outputting binary numbers instead of the usual decimal numbers.  
Tech support won't arrive until tomorrow, but the store needs to continue working. We need to help.

### Input Format

- The first line contains a decimal number — the total amount of goods purchased at the store so far.
- The second line contains a binary number — the amount for the last purchase.

### Output Format

One decimal number — the total revenue for the day, including the last purchase.
