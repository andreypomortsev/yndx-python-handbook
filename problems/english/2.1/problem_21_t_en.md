## [Flies and Cutlets Separately](../../../solutions/2.1/21_t.py)

Let's return to the store, where the owner is already used to relying on all-powerful automation.

Help him solve a problem. Here is his story: "A couple of days ago, I bought two batches of cutlets and by accident, I spilled them onto the same counter. The total weight of the cutlets was $N$ kilograms, and the price was $M$ rubles per kilogram. Today, I discovered that the invoices for these types of cutlets were lost, but I remember that the first type of cutlets cost $K_{1}$ rubles per kilogram, and the second type cost $K_{2}$.

Help me recall the weight of each batch of cutlets so I can account for them properly."
