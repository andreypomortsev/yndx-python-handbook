## [Lord of Numbers: The Fellowship of the Common Digit](../../../solutions/2.2/22_m.py)

In the times of magic and dragons, it was believed that numbers possessed great power capable of changing the world.

It all began with the writing of great numbers. Three numbers were given to the elves. Seven were given to the lords of the dwarves. And nine... were given to the human race.

But they were all deceived, for there was one more number. In the land of Numia, on a sheet of dark papyrus, the lord Zeron secretly wrote the Unified Digit, which ruled over all great numbers.

Let's find out what this digit is.
