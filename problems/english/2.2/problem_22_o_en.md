## [Lord of Numbers: The Return of Caesar](../../../solutions/2.2/22_o.py)

To defeat the evil, there is only one step left â€” destroy Zeron's lair.

To do this, we need to create a three-digit magical number that will be stronger than Zeron's two two-digit protective numbers.

The simplest way to create a strong number:

- Take the largest digit from all the protective numbers.
- Take the smallest digit from all the protective numbers.
- Place the sum of the remaining digits (without carrying over the digits) in the middle.

Help us defeat the evil!
