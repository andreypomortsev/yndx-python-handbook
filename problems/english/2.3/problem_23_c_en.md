## [Counting Game](../../../solutions/2.3/23_c.py)

The kids in kindergarten are learning numbers, and we can help them with this.
The kids give us two numbers â€” the start and the end of a sequence of numbers.
Our task is to output all the numbers from the start to the end, filling in the gap between them.

### Input Format

Two numbers in ascending order, each on a new line.

### Output Format:

All numbers from start to end (inclusive), written separated by spaces.

### Example 1

**Input**
```plaintext

10
```

**Output**
```plaintext
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

### Example 2

**Input**
```plaintext
-3
3
```

**Output**
```plaintext
-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3
```
