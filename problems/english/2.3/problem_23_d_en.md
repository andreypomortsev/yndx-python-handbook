## [Counting Game 2.0](../../../solutions/2.3/23_d.py)

The kids continue learning numbers, and we keep helping them.
Once again, we are given the start and end of a sequence of numbers, and we output them along with the numbers in between.

### Input Format

Two numbers, each on a new line.

### Output Format:

All numbers from start to end (inclusive), written separated by spaces.

### Example 1
