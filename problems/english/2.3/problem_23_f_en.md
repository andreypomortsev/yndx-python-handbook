## [GCD](../../../solutions/2.3/23_f.py)

At one of the local research institutes, it is often necessary to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
You are already trusted as one of the best "automators" around, so the institute's management has decided to commission software from you.

### Input Format

Two natural numbers are entered, each on its own line.

### Output Format:

Output a single natural numberâ€”the GCD of the two given numbers.

### Note

The most common method for finding the GCD is the [Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm).
