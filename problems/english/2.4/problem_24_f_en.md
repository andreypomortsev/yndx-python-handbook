## [GCD 2.0](../../../solutions/2.4/24_f.py)

One of the local research institutes often needs to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of several numbers. Since they trust you, they’ve come to you with this task again.

### Input Format

The first line contains a single number $N$ — the amount of data.  
Each of the following $N$ lines contains one natural number.

### Output Format

Output a single natural number — the GCD of all the given numbers (excluding $N$).

### Note

The most common method for finding the GCD is the Euclidean Algorithm.
