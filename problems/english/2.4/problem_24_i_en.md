The children can't calm down and continue "tormenting" numbers. Now, they want to collectively create a very large number.  
Each child calls out a number consisting of digits they know. Write a program that creates a number made of the maximum digits from each child.

### Input Format

The first line contains a number $N$ â€” the number of children in the group. Then, each of the next $N$ lines contains a number.

### Output Format

A single large number.
