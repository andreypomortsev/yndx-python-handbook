## [Number Snake](../../../solutions/2.4/24_n.py)

Unfortunately, the ordinary rectangles quickly bored the children. Now the teacher needs a new program. Write a program that builds a number snake of the required size.

### Input format

The first line contains the number $N$ — the height of the numeric rectangle.  
The second line contains the number $M$ — the width of the numeric rectangle.

### Output format:

You need to output the formed number snake of the required size.  
To make the rectangle look nice, each column should have the same width.
