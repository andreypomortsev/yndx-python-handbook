## [Mass exponentiation](../../../solutions/3.1/31_m.py)

There are often difficulties when you need to perform a large number of repetitive operations. In such cases, people want to simplify their work. Write a program that raises all the numbers provided by the users to a given power.

### Input Format

A natural number $N$ is entered — the number of numbers.\
Each of the next $N$ lines contains one number.\
The last line contains a natural number $P$ — the power to which the numbers should be raised.

### Output Format:

A sequence of numbers that are the answers.
