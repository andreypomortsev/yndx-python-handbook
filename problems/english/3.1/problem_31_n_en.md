## [Mass Exponentiation 2.0](../../../solutions/3.1/31_n.py)

Let's continue simplifying our work by skipping many identical operations.\
We will create a new program that raises all the numbers provided by the user to a given power.

### Input Format

The first line contains a sequence of natural numbers, separated by spaces.\
The second line contains a natural number $P$ â€” the power to which the numbers should be raised.

### Output Format:

A sequence of numbers that are the answers.\
The numbers should be printed in one line, separated by spaces.

### Example 1
