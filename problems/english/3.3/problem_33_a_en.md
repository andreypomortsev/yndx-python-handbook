## [List of Squares](../../../solutions/3.3/33_a.py)

Most of the tasks in this chapter are focused on practicing list comprehension skills.

You will be given two variables, `a` and `b`. Write a list comprehension to get the squares of numbers in the range $[a,b]$.

### Note

There should be nothing in the solution except the list comprehension.

### Example 1

__Input__
```plaintext
a = 1
b = 5
```

__Output__
```plaintext
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### Example 2

__Input__
```plaintext
a = -5
b = 5
```

__Output__
```plaintext
[25, 16, 9, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
