## [Set of All Perfect Squares](../../../solutions/3.3/33_e.py)

A perfect square is a natural number that is the square of another natural number. For example: 1, 25, 144.

You will be given a list `numbers` containing natural numbers.

Develop an expression to generate a set of all numbers that are perfect squares.

### Note

There should be nothing in the solution except the expression.

### Example 1

__Input__
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

__Output__
```plaintext
{1, 4}
```

### Example 2

__Input__
```python
numbers = [number for number in range(16, 100, 4)]
```

__Output__
```plaintext
{16, 64, 36}
