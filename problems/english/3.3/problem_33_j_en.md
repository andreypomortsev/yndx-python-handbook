## [RLE Reversed](../../../solutions/3.3/33_j.py)

You will be given a list of tuples `rle` with characters and their repetition counts.

Write an expression to generate the string from which this list was derived.

### Note

There should be nothing in the solution except the expression.

### Example 1

__Input__
```plaintext
rle = [('a', 2), ('b', 3), ('c', 1)]
```

__Output__
```plaintext
'aabbbc'
```

### Example 2

__Input__
```plaintext
rle = [('1', 1), ('0', 2), ('5', 1), ('0', 2)]
```

__Output__
```plaintext
'100500'
```
