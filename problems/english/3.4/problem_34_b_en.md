## [Gathering for a walk](../../../solutions/3.4/34_b.py)

The kindergarten teacher is tired of spending time arranging children in pairs.

The teacher agreed with the children that they would split into two roughly equal groups.

Write a program that, given two lines of children’s names, forms pairs.

### Input Format

Two lines of input are given, each containing children’s names separated by commas and spaces.

### Output Format:

The program should output a list of pairs that can be formed by taking one child from each line sequentially.\
Names in each pair should be separated by a hyphen surrounded by spaces.

### Note

One of the groups may have one child more than the other.\
This child should not be included in the pairs and will be paired with the teacher.

### Example

__Input__
```plaintext
Аня, Вова
Боря, Дима, Гена
```

__Output__
```plaintext
Аня - Боря
Вова - Дима
```
