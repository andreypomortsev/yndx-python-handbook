## [Functional GCD 2.0](../../../solutions/4.2/42_c.py)

Write a function `gcd` that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a sequence of numbers.\
The function takes a variable number of natural numbers as arguments, with at least one required.

### Note

Your solution should contain only functions.\
The solution should not include calls to the required functions.

### Example 1

__Input__
```python
result = gcd(3)
```

__Output__
```plaintext
result = 3
```

### Example 2

__Input__
```python
result = gcd(36, 48, 156, 100500)
```

__Output__
```plaintext
