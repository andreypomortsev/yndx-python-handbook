## [Class Point](../../../solutions/5.1/51_a.py)

Object-oriented programming is a popular paradigm in the modern world. This is quite obvious, as any real-world object can now be represented as a digital set of fields and methods. Let's start designing classes.

Develop a `Point` class that, upon initialization, takes the coordinates of a point in the Cartesian plane and stores them in the fields `x` and `y` respectively.

### Note

Your solution should only contain classes and functions.\
The solution should not contain initialization calls of the required classes.

### Example 1

__Input__
```python
point = Point(3, 5)
print(point.x, point.y)
```

__Output__
```plaintext
3 5
```

### Example 2

__Input__
```python
point = Point(2, -7)
print(point.x, point.y)
```

__Output__
```plaintext
2 -7
```
