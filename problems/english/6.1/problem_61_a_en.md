## [Mathematics is Cool, But that's not Certain](../../../solutions/6.1/61_a.py)

Let's recall the beginning of our task book when everything was simple: we didn't use loops, collections, or object-oriented programming. We only had input data, and the task was to provide the result.

Write a program that calculates the value of the function:

$$
f(x) = \log_{32} x^ \frac{3}{16} + x ^ {cos \frac {\pi \cdot x}{2 \cdot e}} - \sin^2 \frac{x}{\pi}
$$

### Input format

A real number $x$ is entered.

### Output format

A single number â€” the value of the function at the given point.
