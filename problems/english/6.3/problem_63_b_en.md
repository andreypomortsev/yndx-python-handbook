## [Summing Responses](../../../solutions/6.3/63_b.py)

Write a program that sums the data transmitted from the server.

If the server sends the number 0, it means the data has finished, and it will restart the response output.

### Input Format

The server address is provided.

### Output Format

A single number â€” the sum of all data received from the server.
